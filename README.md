# Emerald-Attendance
A simple XML based attendance management program which makes use of a web server to store and manage data.

# Setup
Due to server up keep issues, there is no longer a demo server online, but the application can be configured to pull data of another server. 

To point Emerald Attendance to your server, edit lines 84 and 373 - 376  in LoginForm.cs with your apportiate server information. In addition to changing the server info, ensure there is a XML file on your server named database.xml to ensure the application is able to store/manage data.
